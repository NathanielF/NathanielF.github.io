This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(mlogit)
library(bayesm)

df = read.csv('TravelMode.csv')
#df$choice <- df$choice == 'no'
#df$mode <- as.factor(df$mode)
df

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

df |> group_by(mode) |> summarize(vcost=median(vcost), 
                                  wait = median(wait),
                                  travel = median(travel))



```

```{r}

df_long = mlogit.data(df, choice='choice', shape='long', alt.var = "mode")
df_long


```


```{r}
mnl = mlogit(choice ~ vcost + wait + travel | 1, data=df_long)
mnl |> summary()

```

```{r}

nmnl = mlogit(choice ~ vcost + travel + wait, 
              data=df_long, reflevel = 'air', 
              nests=list(land = c('car', 'bus', 'train'), 
                         air = c('air')
                         ), 
              un.nest.el = TRUE
              )
summary(nmnl)

```

```{r}
options(scipen=999)
data("Heating", package = "mlogit")
H <- dfidx(Heating, choice = "depvar", varying = c(3:12))
m <- mlogit(depvar ~ ic + oc | 1, H, 
            nests=list(room = c("er", "gr"), 
                       central = c("ec", "gc", "hp")))
summary(m)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
