In April 2024 I gave a talk at PyData Berlin on the usage of bayesian imputation techniques in people analytics. The Slides can be found [here](https://nathanielf.github.io/talks/missing_data/missing_data_causal.html#/title-slide)

But the recording of the talk has been published on youtube here too.
