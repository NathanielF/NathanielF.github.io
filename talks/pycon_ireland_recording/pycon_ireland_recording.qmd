In November 2023 I gave a talk at PyCon Ireland on the usage of discrete choice models for the estimation of market share. The Slides can be found [here](https://nathanielf.github.io/talks/pycon_ireland/pycon_ireland_discrete.html#/title-slide)

But the recording of the talk has been published on youtube here too.
