# The Pitch
Agnostic statistical methods in causal inference are well motivated but limited in scope. 

We'll show how Bayesian non-parametrics are natural framwork in with which to couch and extend these methods

## Agenda

![](images/three_acts.png)

## Propaganda
### Full Luxury Bayesianism

![Posterior Predictive Imputation of Treatment Effects](images/thepitch_meme.jpeg)

## Non Parametric Bayes Formula
### Full Luxury Bayesianism

$$ p(\color{blue}{\theta} |D) \propto p(D | \color{blue}{\theta})p(D) $$

where $\color{blue}{\theta}$ is an explict model parameter becomes

$$ p(\color{blue}{G} |D) \propto p(D | \color{blue}{G})p(D) $$

where $\color{blue}{G}$ is a general stochastic process

## Strong Ignorability and Propensity Scores
### Definitions

- Potential Outcomes
    - $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ under different treatment regimes $T \in \{ 0, 1\}$
- Strong Ignorability
    - Outcomes are independent of the treatment assignment given a covariate profile $X$: $Y(0), Y(1)  \perp\!\!\!\perp T | X$ 
- Propensity Scores
    - An estimate of the probability for a particular treatment status conditional on the covariate profile $X$: $0 \leq p_{t}(X) \leq 1$


## BART Models and Non-Parametric Estimation

- BART
    - Bayesian Additive Regression Trees
    - "[B]lack-box method based on the sum of many trees where priors are used to regularize inference"

- Non-Parametric Estimation
    - Outcomes and Propensity Scores can be estimated using non-parametric methods
    - Causal estimands can be estimated using posterior predictive imputation under different treatment regimes
    - Benefit of minimalist structural assumptions.

## Inverse Propensity Score Weighting
 
- Adjustment by representative Weighting
    - Using the propensity scores as a summary metric for group membership, we down-weight and upweight the prevalence of high and low propensity score in each group to induce __strong ignorability__ like conditions.

## Robust and Doubly Robust Methods
### Differing Weighting Schemes

- Raw
    - $\sum\frac{1}{N}\Big[ Y(1) \cdot \frac{1}{p_{T}(X)} - (Y(0)\cdot\frac{1}{1-p_{T}(X)}) \Big]$
- Doubly Robust
    - $$ \hat{Y(1)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{0}^{N} \Bigg[ \frac{T(Y - m_{1}(X))}{p_{T}(X)} + m_{1}(X) \Bigg] \\ \hat{Y(0)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{0}^{N} \Bigg[ \frac{(1-T)(Y - m_{0}(X))}{(1-p_{T}(X))} + m_{0}(X) \Bigg] $$

## Miscalibrated Propensity Scores
### What is the Estimand?

> "Each theoretical estimand is linked to an empirical  estimand involving only observable quantities (e.g. a difference in means in a population) by assumptions about the relationship between the data we observe and the data we do not." - Lundberg et al in _What is your Estimand_

- Q1. What are we aiming at when we estimate propensity scores for highly granular covariate profiles?
- Q2. What happens when the sample data has no treatment data cases for a particular covariate profile?

## Overfitting
### BART models can achieve perfect Allocation

## Parametric Mediation

![Traditional Model Based Mediation](images/Mediation_Model.png)

## Causal Mediation Analysis
### Non-Parametric Estimation

- __NDE:__ $E[Y(t, M(t^{*})) - Y(t^{*}, M(t^{*}))]$
    - Which is to say we're interested in the differences in the imputed outcomes under different treatments, mediated by values for M under a specific treatment regime. 
- __NIE:__ $E[(Y(t, M(t))) - Y(t, M(t^{*}))]$
    - Which amounts to the imputed differences in the outcome Y due to differences in the treatment regimes which generated the mediation values M. 
- __TE__: NDE + NIE

## Conclusions {.smaller}
### Structural Beliefs and Bayesian Inference

- Propensity score adjustment reflects the belief in the need for adjustment
    - It reflects a belief in the adequacy of the propensity score model for achieving balance
- Regression based imputation of treatment effects reflects the belief that covariate controls eliminates selection effects
- Doubly Robust methods reflect the belief that either the propensity or outcome model is mispecified. 
    - But that one ought to be adequately specified.
- Debiased ML methods reflect the belief that mis-specification can be corrected by cross-validation and non-parametric estimation of residuals in FWL theorem
- Mediation Analysis reflects the belief that the causal influence must be interepreted with particular causal structure to avoid confounding. 
- __There are no truly Agnostic statistics__:In each case sound inference proceeds as we take steps to adjust our model or the conditions of its assessment as informed by our best beliefs regarding the problem to hand.
