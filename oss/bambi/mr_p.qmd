# Regression as Stratification

In this project I sought to understand the procedure of post-stratification adjustment used in election forecasting and regression modelling of the same. I published the documentation for the technique of using Multilevel Regression and post-stratification (MrP) with the bambi package [here](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/notebooks/mister_p.html). In this work i tried to elaborate precisely how and why the careful modeller would want to make stratum specific adjustments to the predictions of regression models.


I adapted the work of  Martin, Philips and Gelmen’s “Multilevel Regression and Poststratification Case Studies” that can be found [here](https://bookdown.org/jl5522/MRP-case-studies/introduction-to-mister-p.html#estimational-subgroup-level). You can download the worked example [here](mister_p.html)
