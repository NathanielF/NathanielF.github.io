# Structural Equation and Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models

This project started as an exploration into the nature of contemportary bayesian model development workflow as applied to psychometric models. The details were spelled out [here](https://nathanielf.github.io/posts/post-with-code/CFA_AND_SEM/CFA_AND_SEM.html). The project culminated in a publication to the official PyMC documentation that can be found online [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/case_studies/CFA_SEM.html)
