# Autoregressive Forecasting in PyMC

This project stemmed from a gap in the PyMC documentation around how to use a fitted auto-regressive model to make forecasts about the future state of the world. In this project I demonstrate how fit and make predictictions with bayesian structural timeseries models. 

The project culminated in a publication to the official PyMC documentation that can be found online [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/time_series/Forecasting_with_structural_timeseries.html) or downloaded as notebook [here](Forecasting_with_structural_timeseries_orig.html)

The notebook demonstates these techniques applied to a series of fake data building in complexity as we add more structure.
