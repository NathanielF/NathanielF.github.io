# Bayesian Vector Autoregressive Models

In this project I demonstrated how to fit a hierarchical bayesian autoregressive model in PyMC. The work drew on a PyMC labs blogpost showing how to fit a simple VAR model in PyMC. We applied these types of model to econometric timeseries data to analyse the relationships between GDP, investment and consumption for Ireland. 

The project culminated in a publication to the official PyMC documentation that can be found online [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/time_series/bayesian_var_model.html) or downloaded as notebook [here](bayesian_var_model_orig.html)
