# Bayesian Workflow

In this project I demonstrated how to fit an escalating series of structural equation models. Emphasising the iterative and expansionary method of model fit and assessment as recommended in the contemporary Bayesian workflow. 

The project culminated in a publication to the official PyMC documentation that can be found online [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/case_studies/bayesian_sem_workflow.html#bayesian-workflow-with-sems) or downloaded as notebook [here](bayesian_sem_workflow.html)
