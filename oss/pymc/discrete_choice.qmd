## Discrete Choice and Subjective Utility

In this project I demonstrated how to fit a discrete choice models using random utility components in PyMC. I applied these types of model to micro-econometric data over product choice to estimate market share and the correlation among good within an market. 

The project culminated in a publication to the official PyMC documentation that can be found online [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/generalized_linear_models/GLM-discrete-choice_models.html) or downloaded as notebook [here](GLM-discrete-choice_models.html)
