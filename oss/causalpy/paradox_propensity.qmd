# The Paradox of Bayesian Propensity

In this project I sought to outline the process of justifying the use of propensity scores in bayesian outcome regressions in [CausalPy](https://causalpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). We emphasised the role of propensity scores in Bayesian inference. The focus was on the manner in which the estimation of a causal treatment effects using propensity scores require a two-stage strategy to avoid biasing the propensity score distribution.  The demonstration can be seen [here](https://causalpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/inv_prop_latent.html) or downloaded as a notebook [here](inv_prop_latent.html)

Propensity scores are celebrated as a cornerstone of causal inference, offering elegant solutions to selection bias through inverse weighting and covariate balancing. Yet a provocative paradox emerges in Bayesian analysis: when you already condition on all relevant covariates, propensity scores should theoretically contain no additional information—they mathematically cancel out. So why do sophisticated Bayesian practitioners still rely on them? 

We see a striking pattern: joint Bayesian models consistently misestimate treatment effects compared to two-stage approaches __when using propensity score adjustments in the outcome model__. The culprit is a violation of causal ordering: when you model propensity scores and outcomes simultaneously, information flows backwards in time, allowing observed outcomes to reshape your understanding of treatment assignment. By forcing a modular, two-stage approach, propensity scores can be retained and useful. The modular approach enforcse the temporal precedence of treatment assignment over outcomes reflecting the data generating process better.
