Arguably John Snow's cholera experiment in London demonstrates the exact same reasoning.

Therefore, we should see small declines in gonorrhea incidence among 15-year-olds in 1986 relative to Roe states. In 1987, two cohorts in our data are treated in the repeal states relative to Roe, so we should see larger effects in absolute value than we saw in 1986. But from 1988 to 1991, we should at most see only three net treated cohorts in the repeal states because starting in 1988, the Roe state cohorts enter and begin erasing those differences. Starting in 1992, the effects should get smaller in absolute value until 1992, beyond which there should be no difference between repeal and Roe states.\n",

The literature on the differences in differences is vast and spiralling around complexities of correct estimation under different conditions with time-varying treatment effects. We've only gestured to some of the issues, but I hope you find the experimental design sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation. "
