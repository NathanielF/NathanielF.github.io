        "Statistical models both encode structure in their definition and learn structure as they are calibrated against real data. There is a tension between how much structure we encode and how much we allow the model to discover. Too much discovery turns the model into a black-box and we lose some interpretability, too much encoded structure and we bias the discovery and risk losing sight of the data genersting process. \n",

In this blog post we're going to dive into modelling of non-linear functions and explore some of the tooling available in the python eco-system. We'll start by looking into Generalised Additive Models with splines in `pyGAM` before proceeding to look at Bayesian versions of spline modelling comparing the splines to Gaussian processes in `Bambi` and `PyMC`. Before showing how hierarchical bayesian models avoid some of the issues of overfit in simpler spline models. \n",

We'll see how the methods work in the case of relatively straightforward toy example and then we'll apply each of the methods to deriving insights into the functional form of insurance loss curves. In this application we adapt a data set discussed in Mick Cooney's `Stan` [case study](https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/losscurves_casestudy.html) to demonstrate the power of hierarchical spline models. Throughout we'll draw on the discussion of these methods in Osvaldo Martin's _\"Bayesian Analysis with Python\"_ for practical details implementing these models. \n",

        "Another observation in a similar vein is that penalised spline models are provably [equivalent](https://www.tjmahr.com/random-effects-penalized-splines-same-thing/) to hierarchical regression (random effects) models. This is striking because the character of these types of model seems diametrically opposed. With spline models you jerry-rig your features to an optimisation goal, with hierarchical model you tend to impose theoretical structure to induce shrinkage. It's hard to see how this works - with a penalised spline model are you inducing a hierarchy of latent features you can't name? Should you even try to translate between the two!? The abstract components of our model is less graspable than the predictive performance. The qualitative character of theory buiding differs markedly across these abstractions and aesthetics and explainability feature heavily in model preference. \n",

This demonstrates something of the interplay between in-sample approximation and out of sample generalisation we saw above in the case of the insurance curve development. The additional structure insists on commensurate realisations under different counterfactual settings reflective of the fact that countries do not vary so radically. \n",

        "We can see here how the combined components borrow the structure of the outcome variable primarily from the income variable component. The health measures have closer to zero additive contribution while the uncertainty in the educational component varies wildly. But the blue educational component here is used primarily as a scaling contribution which adds to the level of the outcome variable rather than distorting the shape. These initially opaque synthetic features of splines can offer deep insight into the structure of our data generating process when seen correctly. \n",

        "\n",
        "We've seen the application of splines as univariate smoothers to approximate wiggly curves of arbitrary shape. We've also tried gaussian process approximations of the same univariate functions. The suggested flexibility of both methods is a strength, but we need to be careful where splines have a tendency to over-fit to individual curves. As such we have tried to show that we can incorporate spline basis modelling in a hierarchical bayesian model and recover more compelling posterior predictive checks and additionally derive predictiions from the mixed variant of the hierarhical model which helps us understand the implications of the data for generic forecasts of insurance loss curves. Finally we showed how splines can be used additively to model non-linear functions of multiple covariates. These are a powerful tool to interrogate complex non-linear relationships, but they offer interpolation of functions within a well understood domain. Applealing to these models for extrapolation needs to be done carefully. \n",
        "\n",
        "We can, I think, draw a broad moral from this presentation. Observed phenomena admit description with a wide variety of mathematical abstraction. The \"correctness\" of the abstraction is never the right question. The manner in which one abstraction distils the structure of reality is not fundamentally any better than the manner in which an alternative scheme will do so. Predictive success achieved applying one abstraction can be traded off for interpretive tractability in another. What matters is the task at hand - solving the problem. Sometimes problems can be solved with new information, but mostly they're resolved by re-arranging assumptions and phrasing the problem anew - seeing through a different lens, pulling the door handle where we previously pushed. Splines, hierarhical splines, gaussian process modelling are all attempts at approximating an answer by rephrasing the question. The more of these tools we have the better we are prepared to tackle novel problems, discern the pertinent structure in the world. "
