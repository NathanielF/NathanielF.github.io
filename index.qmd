# Intro

Welcome to my site! 

You'll find a range of writings on data science, philosophy, statistics and inference more generally. I'll update this site with semi-regular blog entries, and any talks or presentations on these topics. 

## Bio

I'm a data scientist specialising in probabilistic modelling for the study of risk and causal inference. I have experience in model development, deployment, multivariate testing and monitoring. 

I'm interested in questions of inference and measurement in the face of natural variation and confounding. 

My academic background is in mathematical logic and philosophy where I mostly imagined possible worlds and modal logics.
